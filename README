WWW::Scraper::Delicious version 0.10

This module implements a very simple and effective way to scrape links
from the http://del.icio.us/ site without the requirement of using the
del.icio.us API, authentication, or RSS. Although links can be scraped
from any valid del.icio.us URL, the intended use of this module is to
provide users a simple way to backup and/or mirror their own links.
There is no hard limit for the number of user links that can be
returned, but a limit of 100 is respected for other types of link
queries.
